- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
I don't mind it. I feel like it makes visualizing my code easier because I can better see what connects and what doesn't need to.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I found it hard to make all the required connections to Train. I also got a little confused with where to initalize lists and how to create a set length. But going to TA hours helped - I would definitely recommended going.
